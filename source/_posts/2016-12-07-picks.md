##### [Markus][markus]
- [How much memory is my process using?][markus-1] - Sounds like an easy question that can be suprisingly hard to answer.
- [Small Details, Big Impact By Yehuda Katz and Liz Baillie][markus-2] - Contains both programming and design examples.
- [A Precious Hour][markus-3]

##### [Max][max]
- [Jenn Schiffer at xoxo Festival][max-1] - Awesome, funny, entertaining but somewhere also sad and serious talk vaguely about satire in tech.
- [The European Ruby Revolution][max-2] - Interesting observations on the differences between the European and US Ruby community when it comes to the future of Ruby and a more diverse ecosystem.
- [Yarn Support][max-3] - Rails 5.1 will support alternative solutions for managing assets: [yarn][yarn] and [webpack][webpack].
