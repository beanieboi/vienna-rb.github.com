### 06/22 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the one-hundred-sixty-fourth edition:

##### [Markus][9]:
- [The rise and fall of the Dungeon Master][10] - A new anti-pattern.
- [“There Shall Be no Bugs” Is a Dangerous Pipe Dream][11] - Sometimes, it seems like we could write bug-free code, if only we all used $paradigm-language-or-framework-of-the-week. Alas&hellip;
- [!!Con 2016 - Code in Spaaaaaace!!!!! by Katie Bechtold][12] - How to write code when the machine running it is far, far, really far away, and rapidly travelling farther away?

##### [Max][17]:
- [Exceptions and Observers][18] - How to use Ruby's implementation of the observer pattern without breaking contracts.
- [Elixir Is Neat But What Can You Actually Do With It?][19] - An interesting alternative to trying to blindly port all your Rails skills to an Elixir-Phoenix project.
- [Internships: Good for the Intern, Great for the Team][20] - Internships as a chance to increase diversity, niceness, thinking and learning in your company.
