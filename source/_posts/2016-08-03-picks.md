### 08/03 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the one-hundred-seventieth edition:

##### [Markus][9]:
- [Life as an impatient programmer][10] - Impatience can be a virtue, too, if channeled correctly. (Next up: [Laziness and hubris][wall])
- [Fun vs. Computer Science][11] - Technology choices, and their (non-) impact on the users (or players) of your program.
- [The leap second: Because our clocks are more accurate than the Earth][12] - Keeping accurate measurements of time in sync with the earth is hard.

##### [Max][13]:
- [hack.css][14] - A nice, rather minimalistic, [zeit.co][max-zeitco]-inspired CSS framework *(it even has a [dark mode][max-darkmode])*
- [How We Replaced React with Phoenix][15] - How to painlessly replace React with Phoenix (and Turbolinks) and be happy about it.
- [The Ruby Bibliography][16] - Peer-reviewed scientific papers on and around Ruby.
