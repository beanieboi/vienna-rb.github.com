### 08/10 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the one-hundred-seventy-first edition:

##### [Markus][9]:
- [The “Goal” of Performance Tuning][10] - It's not just about making things faster.
- [Benchmarking correctly is hard (and techniques for doing it better)][11] - Julia Evans explains how you can go wrong when benchmarking, and how you can do better.
- [7 HTTP headers to secure your app for the busy web developer][12] - Exactly what it says on the tin.

##### [Max][13]:
- [The dark side of the Rack and Websockets dreams][14] - An opinionated but still interesting and constructive rant on the current state of real time web in Ruby and what could be done about it.
- [ROM 2.0.0 Released][15] - ROM as an alternative to ActiveRecord hit the stage where its infrastructure is finally complete.
- [ZEIT, HyperTerm, and now][16] - [Guillermo Rauch][rauch] on the Changelog podcast with some interesting thoughts on design processes, [Slack][slack], the terminal and text-based UIs in general.
