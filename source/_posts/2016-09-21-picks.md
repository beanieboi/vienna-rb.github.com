### 09/21 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the one-hundred-seventy-seventh edition:

##### [Markus][markus]
- [A mistake is just a moment in time][markus-2] - Not every mistake needs correcting.
- [Using security features to do bad things][markus-3] - Just because a feature increases security doesn't mean it too can be abused for nefarious purposes.
- [Why Star Trekâ€™s Prime Directive could never be enforced][markus-1]

##### [Max][max]
- [Suture][max-1] - A nifty gem to help you refactor legacy code.
- [Succession][max-2] - Awesome example driven talk by the awesome [Katrina Owen][katrina-owen] on the thoughts and epiphanies of refactoring.
