### 11/30 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the one-hundred-eighty-seventh edition:

##### [Markus][markus]
- [Let Postgres Do The Work][markus-1] - A demo of how you can offload work onto PostgreSQL, which can have the nice side effect of making everything much faster.
- [A Rubyist looks at Crystal (Part 2)][markus-2] - Continuing from [Part 1][crystal-part-1], this post goes deeper into the unique features Crystal has in relation to Ruby.
- [Inspecting C's qsort Through Animation][markus-3] - Various sorting algorithms animated, showing nicely how they work internally.

##### [Max][max]
- [That Works?!][max-1] - Talk on quines, the true (ninja) art of programming (e.g. rewriting any JS program using only six chars).
- [Introduction to Concurrency in Ruby][max-2] - Talk showcasing various options for having Ruby do things simultaneously.
