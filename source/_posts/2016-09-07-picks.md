### 09/07 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the one-hundred-seventy-fifth edition:


##### [Laura][laura]
- [How do you decide what to work on?][laura-1] - Julia Evans on coming up with a focus at work.
- [The Imposter's handbook][laura-2] - A book for "self-taught developers who have never taken the time to learn foundational concepts".

##### [Ramón][ramon]
- [][ramon-1] -
- [][ramon-2] -
- [][ramon-3] -

##### [Markus][markus]
- [CloudFlare, SSL and unhealthy security absolutism][markus-1] - Security is not an absolute state, it's always relative. And any improvements to it are beneficial.
- [The “network partitions are rare” fallacy][markus-2]
- [The Underestimated Merits of Copying Someone Else’s Work][markus-3] - Copying other's work can be a useful learning tool. Just don't claim the copied work as your own.

##### [Max][max]
- [mruby CLI][max-1] - Forget about [Go][go], build native commandline apps in Ruby and ship them as a binary.
- [Deoptimizing Ruby][max-2] - What's this thing about "deoptimizing" and what role does [Truffle][] play in it?
- [Examining The Internals Of The Rails Request/Response Cycle][max-3] - What people call "Rails magic".
