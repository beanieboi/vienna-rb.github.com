### 07/13 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the one-hundred-sixty-seventh edition:

##### [Ramón][5]:
- [Macmoji][6] - Slack-style emojis for Mac using auto-expand!

##### [Markus][9]:
- [Flirting with Crystal, a Rubyist Perspective][10] - Fabio Akita makes the point for Crystal as a "gap language" between the high-level languages like Ruby and lower-level languages like Go or Rust.
- [Hop off the tutorial treadmill with comment-driven development][11] - This sounds especially useful if you want to learn a new programming language or framework.
- [Mastering Programming][12] - Kent Beck on the patterns he has observed in master programmers.

##### [Max][13]:
- [Make Small Things][14] - Awesome episode of the Bikeshed podcast, with [Sandi Metz][sandimetz] on everything from object oriented design, over approaches to naming things, up to pre-conferences shakes - live from Rails Conf.
- [Principles and mottos: misunderstood and applied][15] - Decompressing Rails' principles and conventions to check if we understand and apply them in a healthy way.
- [Ecto 2 and Phoenix Presence][16] - José Valim and Chris McCord on the Changelog, sharing interesting insights on the way and future of [Phoenix][phoenix], applying some cutting edge computer science in the wild.
