### 08/24 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the one-hundred-seventy-third edition:


##### [Laura][1]
- [Testing for people who hate testing][2] - A great, language-agnostic resource on what to test and how to test it
- [The Force of Habit][3] - (self-promotion) A post about building good habits and starting an unofficial study group for women one full day a week this summer.

##### [Ramón][5]
- [][6] -
- [][7] -
- [][8] -

##### [Markus][9]
- [More shell, less egg][10] - On writing programs from scratch, vs. combining small tools
- [Programming Doesn’t Require Talent or Even Passion][11]
- [Programming principles from the early days of id Software][12] - John Romero on some of the principles id (of Doom and Quake fame) ran on back then. Some of them are even a good idea today.

##### [Max][13]
- [Opinionated presenters for Rails 5][14] - Nifty and lightweight presenters to finally get your Rails helper mess under control.
- [The Ruby Community and Reputation][15] - Rant on the current state of the Rails community, even reaching out to [J2EE][j2ee], [Archlinux][arch] and [Steve Jobs][steve].
- [Sinatra Two Point Oh!][16] - Sinatra 2.0 has its first pre-release!
