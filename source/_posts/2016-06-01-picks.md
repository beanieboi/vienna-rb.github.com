### 06/01 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the one-hundred-sixty-first edition:

##### [Laura][1]:
- [Rails Has Won: The Elephant in the Room][2] - Highlighting why Rails was a success and still looking at the issue critically, Fabio Akita wrote an article that couples nicely with Piotr Solnica's post shared last week
- [Pushing RubyGems.org forward][3] - For all of us who use Ruby Gems on a (probably) daily basis, [Nick Quaranto][4] wrote a post about the current state of RubyGems.org and helping it go forward by contributing to the project, giving feedback on policies, and more.

- [Your Program is a Special and Unique Snowflake][20] - Deciding on the level of abstraction on an even lower, per line level.
